# LabsTechChallenge
This was my attempt to build a single-page dining app using api.pennlabs.org for the Penn Labs Technical Challenge. It involves creating the UI, interfacing with an API, and building a simple transition to a webview.

# API Reference
This project uses the Penn Labs API for dining halls: http://api.pennlabs.org/dining/venues

# Features
- Displays the dining halls' hours for today at Penn. 
- Reports the current status of each dining hall (open or closed).
- Separates retail dining halls and residential dining halls so its easy to see where would need dining dollars and where would need swipes.
- Clicking on a dining hall leads to a webview with a detailed menu for that specific dining hall.

# How to Use?
1. Download the project form git.
2. Run the application on a simulator.
3. Scroll to see the different dining halls, their current status (open or closed), and their hours for today.
4. click on any dining hall to see their menu for the day.
